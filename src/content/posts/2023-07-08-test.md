<!-- Section 1: Origin of the idea --> 

<h2 id="section1">Origin of the idea</h2> 

<p>

W﻿ith the release of Blizzard's Diablo 4 came plenty of demon-slaying and dopamine hits watching my experience bar fill up. As the grind to level 100 took more experience the higher we got, we soon realised that there were potions available in-game that would increase our exp. gains by 5%. We began applying the effect to our characters but soon realised that the potions expired after 30 minutes. While this usually wouldn't be a problem we became too focused on defeating demons that we forgot to activate the potions buff every 30 minutes, resulting in a significant XP loss.

S﻿ome of my friends opted to put timers on their phones - but where's the fun in that?
