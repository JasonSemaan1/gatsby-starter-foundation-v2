<h2 id="section1">Origin of the idea</h2> 

<p>

W﻿ith the release of Blizzard's Diablo 4 came plenty of demon-slaying and dopamine hits watching my experience bar fill up. As the grind to level 100 took more experience the higher we got, we soon realised that there were potions available in-game that would increase our exp. gains by 5%. We began applying the effect to our characters but soon realised that the potions expired after 30 minutes. While this usually wouldn't be a problem we became too focused on defeating demons that we forgot to activate the potions buff every 30 minutes, resulting in a significant XP loss.

S﻿ome of my friends opted to put timers on their phones - but where's the fun in that?

A﻿ solution seemed simple and came from a question: what was always open when playing Diablo 4 with friends? 

**M﻿onitor 1:** Diablo 4 (obviously)

**M﻿onitor 2:** Discord/Diablo 4 guide

H﻿aving used Discord for many years I was familiar with its support of bots: music-playing, game hosting, information gathering, you name it and there was probably a bot for it.

My idea was to create a bot that pinged my discord server and mentioned my fellow Diablo 4 demon-slayers discord usernames so they would get a notification to remind them it was time to guzzle & grind.
